Household accessories of today are evolving smarter, digitised and automated. Hence, it
is convenient for use and saves more time for people. Several robotic vacuum cleaners
are available in the market whereas only few ones are implemented for wet floor cleaning.
Robotic cleaners have taken major attention in Robotics research due to their effectiveness
in assisting humans. In using the robotic applications for floor cleaning at homes, hotels
offices, hospitals, etc., the robot makes floor cleaning process easy and fast. Utilizing of
wireless robotic cleaning system thereby reduces the human efforts and time spent on
home cleaning process.


Objectives of the Project:
The objective is to reduce the human efforts with respect floor cleaning, increase the
effectiveness of floor cleaning. It is to be achieved by the system through a mobile application. It reduces labour in every sector and avoid over all consumption of time and water.
