Household accessories of today are evolving smarter, digitised and automated. Hence, it
is convenient for use and saves more time for people. Several robotic vacuum cleaners
are available in the market whereas only few ones are implemented for wet floor cleaning.
Robotic cleaners have taken major attention in Robotics research due to their effectiveness
in assisting humans. In using the robotic applications for floor cleaning at homes, hotels
offices, hospitals, etc., the robot makes floor cleaning process easy and fast. Utilizing of
wireless robotic cleaning system thereby reduces the human efforts and time spent on
home cleaning process.


Objectives of the Project:
The objective is to reduce the human efforts with respect floor cleaning, increase the
effectiveness of floor cleaning. It is to be achieved by the system through a mobile application. It reduces labour in every sector and avoid over all consumption of time and water.

Hardware Used:

Arduino Uno basically a micro-controller which will collects and sends the input data depending on the code written in Arduino-IDE. The input data from the Bluetooth module
will be provided to Arduino Uno, which will activates the other parts of the module like
motor driver and Relay.


HC-05 is the Bluetooth module is used in our project. It will act as Communication
Bridge between Arduino UNO and Android Phone. It is a Serial Port Protocol Module,
which signifes that it will communicate with Arduino UNO via Serial communication.


L293D is a Motor Driver IC, It has 16 pins which are used to control a set of two DC motors
simultaneously in any direction. It is based on the concept of H-bridge. The direction of
voltage or current flow will be decided by the H-bridge.


HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, it uses sonar to determine distance to
an object like bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy
and stable readings in an easy-to-use package. It operation is not affected by sunlight or
black material like Sharp rangefnders are (although acoustically soft materials like cloth
can be diffcult to detect). It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver
module.
