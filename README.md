Household accessories of today are evolving smarter, digitised and automated. Hence, it
is convenient for use and saves more time for people. Several robotic vacuum cleaners
are available in the market whereas only few ones are implemented for wet floor cleaning.
Robotic cleaners have taken major attention in Robotics research due to their effectiveness
in assisting humans. In using the robotic applications for floor cleaning at homes, hotels
offices, hospitals, etc., the robot makes floor cleaning process easy and fast. Utilizing of
wireless robotic cleaning system thereby reduces the human efforts and time spent on
home cleaning process.


Objectives of the Project:
The objective is to reduce the human efforts with respect floor cleaning, increase the
effectiveness of floor cleaning. It is to be achieved by the system through a mobile application. It reduces labour in every sector and avoid over all consumption of time and water.

The system model consists of rotating mops on the front. Thereâ€™s also a water pump
and water reservoir. The water pump can be switched on when required to pour water
on the mops and make the mops moist for a proper clean.
Bluetooth communication via an HC-05 Bluetooth module to send the commands to the
most commonly used micro controller- Arduino Uno.
The Ultrasonic Sensor is used for obstacle detection. The driver motor of 75rpm ones used
for the mops, 100rpm plastic geared motors are used for wheels. The robot is powered on
a 12V lead acid battery.


The brief working of the model is as follows. Whenever the user provides the input
in UI of mobile application, command will be transmitted to Arduino Uno via Bluetooth
module. Using this command, Arduino Uno (micro-controller) will carry out the cleaning
action with the help of mops, wiper and water pump.
