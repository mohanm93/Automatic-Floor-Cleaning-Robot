Arduino Uno basically a micro-controller which will collects and sends the input data depending on the code written in Arduino-IDE. The input data from the Bluetooth module
will be provided to Arduino Uno, which will activates the other parts of the module like
motor driver and Relay.


HC-05 is the Bluetooth module is used in our project. It will act as Communication
Bridge between Arduino UNO and Android Phone. It is a Serial Port Protocol Module,
which signifes that it will communicate with Arduino UNO via Serial communication.
