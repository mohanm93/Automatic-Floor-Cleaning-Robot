The advancements made in the technology of robotics have made life of mankind very
much easier and comfortable. Several robotic vacuum cleaners are available on the market
but only few ones implement wet cleaning of floors. In the modern era, the Automatic
Floor Cleaner is required.
The cleaner is designed in such a way that it is capable of cleaning the area reducing the
human effort just by handling it through mobile application. “Automatic Floor Cleaning
Robot” is a Smartphone controlled robot.
The project uses HC-05 Bluetooth module to send the commands to the most commonly
used micro controller- Arduino UNO. To avoid obstacles there is an obstacle sensor. The
robot is powered on a 12V lead acid battery. The driver motors of 75rpm are used for the
mops on the front of the robot, 100rpm dc motors are used for wheels. There is also a
water pump and the reservoir, which can be switched on when required. It sprays water
on the mop and makes the mops moist for proper clean. There is a wiper at the tail,
which can wipe the excess of water poured on the floor. Ultrasonic sensor is used for
obstacle avoidance.
